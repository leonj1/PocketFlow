# Document Status Messaging Fix

## Problem
When the document generator finished with a low completeness score (30/100), it would:
- Display "Document Generator completed successfully!" 
- Show the completeness score
- But NOT indicate that the document wasn't actually published
- Leave users confused about why the output folder was empty

## Root Cause
The system was correctly preventing low-quality documents from being published, but the messaging didn't reflect this. Users saw a "successful" completion message even when their document failed quality checks.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced EndNode
Now clearly shows:
- ‚úÖ/‚ùå Document Status: PUBLISHED or NOT PUBLISHED
- üìÅ Output location (only if published)
- ‚ùì Specific reason if not published
- üìä Statistics only for published documents

### 2. Improved AbandonNode
Provides detailed information when max attempts reached:
- Final completeness score vs required threshold
- Breakdown of outstanding issues
- Which sections were incomplete
- Helpful suggestions for improvement

### 3. Status Tracking
Added `document_published` flag and `rejection_reason` tracking throughout workflow:
- PublisherNode sets `document_published = True`
- AbandonNode sets reason for abandonment
- SectionRevisionNode tracks why revisions needed

## Example Output

### Before (Confusing):
```
Section Summary:
  - Executive Summary: 329 words, Quality: 8/10
  - Problem Statement: 324 words, Quality: 8/10
  
Document Completeness: 30.0/100

Document Generator completed successfully!
```

### After (Clear):
```
============================================================
DOCUMENT GENERATION SUMMARY
============================================================
‚ùå Document Status: NOT PUBLISHED
‚ùì Reason: Completeness score too low (30/100)

‚ùå Completeness Score: 30.0/100
   (Minimum required: 70/100)

üîÑ Revision Attempts: 3/3

üìù Section Summary:
   ‚úÖ Executive Summary: 329 words, Quality: 8/10
   ‚úÖ Problem Statement: 324 words, Quality: 8/10

============================================================
‚ùå Document generation ended without publishing.
   Review the issues above and try again.
============================================================
