# Feedback List Flattening Fix

## Problem
The original `FeedbackNode.prep()` method in `working_group.py` was failing with:
```
TypeError: sequence item 1: expected str instance, list found
```

This occurred because the committee review nodes were appending feedback that could include nested lists, but the code expected only strings.

## Root Cause
The committee flow was appending feedback items to the shared feedback lists, and sometimes these items were themselves lists or empty strings, causing the `"\n".join()` operation to fail.

## Solution
Updated the `FeedbackNode.prep()` method to:

1. **Flatten nested lists**: If a feedback item is a list, extract all its non-empty elements
2. **Filter empty items**: Skip empty strings and empty lists
3. **Convert to strings**: Ensure all items are strings before joining
4. **Check for empty result**: Return None if no valid feedback remains after filtering

## Code Changes
```python
# Before:
feedback_text = "\n".join([item for item in feedback_list if item])

# After:
# Flatten and filter feedback items, ensuring they are strings
flattened_feedback = []
for item in feedback_list:
    if isinstance(item, list):
        # If item is a list, flatten it
        flattened_feedback.extend([str(sub_item) for sub_item in item if sub_item])
    elif item:  # Non-empty string or other truthy value
        flattened_feedback.append(str(item))

# Check if we have any valid feedback after flattening
if not flattened_feedback:
    return None
    
# Join all non-empty feedback items
feedback_text = "\n".join(flattened_feedback)
```

## Test Results
The fix successfully handles:
- Normal string feedback: `["item1", "item2"]` → `"item1\nitem2"`
- Mixed with empty strings: `["item1", "", "item2"]` → `"item1\nitem2"`
- Nested lists: `["item1", ["nested1", "nested2"]]` → `"item1\nnested1\nnested2"`
- Empty nested lists: `["item1", [], [""]]` → `"item1"`
- All empty: `["", [], [""]]` → `None` (skips processing)

## Impact
This fix ensures robust handling of feedback from various sources, preventing runtime errors when committee members provide feedback in different formats.
