# Document Feedback Implementation

## Overview
The document generation system now fully implements feedback loops at multiple levels, ensuring low-scoring documents are iteratively improved until they meet quality standards.

## Feedback Flow

### 1. Document Completeness Analysis
When a document scores below 70/100, the `DocumentCompletenessNode`:
- Returns `"needs_improvement"` action
- Stores completeness analysis in shared state
- Triggers revision cycle

### 2. Feedback Conversion
The `SectionRevisionNode._convert_completeness_to_section_feedback()` method converts document-level issues to section-specific feedback:

#### Readability Issues → things_to_change
```python
feedback = f"[Readability] {issue.get('issue', '')} {issue.get('suggestion', '')}"
shared["sections"][section_name]["feedback"]["things_to_change"].append(feedback)
```

#### Conceptual Gaps → things_to_add
- **Orphaned concepts**: Concepts mentioned but not explained
- **Undefined terms**: Technical terms lacking definitions  
- **Missing relationships**: Connections between concepts not established
```python
section_name = self._determine_section_for_concept(gap)
feedback = f"[Concept Gap] {gap['message']} {gap.get('suggestion', '')}"
shared["sections"][section_name]["feedback"]["things_to_add"].append(feedback)
```

#### Unfulfilled Goals → things_to_add
Goals from context.yml that haven't been addressed:
```python
section_name = self._determine_section_for_goal(goal)
feedback = f"[Goal] {goal.get('suggestion', goal.get('goal', ''))}"
shared["sections"][section_name]["feedback"]["things_to_add"].append(feedback)
```

#### Scope Violations → things_to_remove
Content outside the defined scope boundaries:
```python
feedback = f"[Scope] {violation.get('message', '')} {violation.get('suggestion', '')}"
shared["sections"][section_name]["feedback"]["things_to_remove"].append(feedback)
```

### 3. Section Assignment Logic

#### Concept Assignment
```python
def _determine_section_for_concept(self, gap):
    # Maps concepts to most appropriate sections
    if "auth" or "token" in concepts → "Chosen Solution"
    if "risk" or "threat" in concepts → "Risks and Mitigations"
    if "implement" or "code" in concepts → "Python Code Example"
    if "track" or "monitor" in concepts → "Steps for Tracking Adoption"
    else → "Problem Statement" (default)
```

#### Goal Assignment
```python
def _determine_section_for_goal(self, goal):
    # Routes goals based on content
    if "implementation" in goal → "Chosen Solution"
    if "risk" in goal → "Risks and Mitigations"
    if "track" in goal → "Steps for Tracking Adoption"
    if "example" in goal → "Python Code Example"
    if "diagram" in goal → "Mermaid Diagram Example"
    else → "Executive Summary" (default)
```

### 4. Section Revision with Feedback

The enhanced `SectionDraftingNode` now:

1. **Detects Revisions**: Checks if version > 0 and feedback exists
2. **Builds Revision Context**: Includes:
   - Previous content
   - Things to remove
   - Things to add
   - Things to change
3. **Adjusts Instructions**: Changes from "Draft" to "Revise"
4. **Incorporates Feedback**: Adds specific instruction to address ALL feedback points
5. **Clears Feedback**: After successful revision, clears feedback to prevent accumulation

Example revision prompt structure:
```
<revision_context>
This is a REVISION of a previously drafted section...

Previous Content:
[Previous section content]

Required Changes:
Things to Remove:
- [Scope] Remove implementation details about database design
- [Scope] Remove references to infrastructure setup

Things to Add:
- [Concept Gap] Explain what JWT tokens are before using the term
- [Goal] Add specific metrics for measuring API adoption

Things to Change:
- [Readability] Simplify technical jargon for business stakeholders
</revision_context>
```

## Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Feedback**: All four types of completeness issues are addressed
2. **Targeted Improvements**: Feedback routed to appropriate sections
3. **Clear Instructions**: Specific, actionable feedback for each section
4. **Iterative Enhancement**: Sections revised with full context
5. **Quality Assurance**: Documents must meet 70% threshold

## Example Scenario

For a document scoring 28.3/100 with:
- 3 readability issues (technical language too complex)
- 5 conceptual gaps (undefined authentication terms)
- 2 unfulfilled goals (missing implementation examples)
- 1 scope violation (infrastructure details included)

The system will:
1. Convert these to section-specific feedback
2. Mark affected sections for revision
3. Provide previous content + specific changes needed
4. Re-draft sections incorporating all feedback
5. Clear feedback after successful revision
6. Re-assemble and re-analyze until score ≥ 70%

This ensures documents iteratively improve based on comprehensive analysis rather than terminating with low quality scores.
