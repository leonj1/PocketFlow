# Document Generation Workflow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Section Review
**Problem**: Sections were drafted but never reviewed, causing document assembly to fail
**Solution**: Added `BatchSectionReviewNode` that reviews all drafted sections after parallel processing

### 2. Broken Completeness Gate
**Problem**: "needs_improvement" action had no connection, causing flow termination
**Solution**: 
- Connected "needs_improvement" to `section_revision_node`
- Added default connection for gate node
- Gate now properly routes low-scoring documents for revision

### 3. No Revision Loop
**Problem**: Low completeness scores didn't trigger revisions
**Solution**: 
- `SectionRevisionNode` now converts completeness issues to section feedback
- Sections marked for revision are reset to "pending" status
- Flow loops back to reprocess revised sections

### 4. Document Assembly Requirements
**Problem**: Assembly required sections to be "reviewed" but review wasn't happening
**Solution**: `BatchSectionReviewNode` marks sections as reviewed after drafting

## Updated Workflow

```
1. SectionBasedLeadNode (check status)
   ↓
2. SectionCoordinator (identify ready sections)
   ↓
3. ParallelSectionNode (draft up to 3 sections)
   ↓
4. BatchSectionReviewNode (review drafted sections) [NEW]
   ↓
5. Loop back to step 1 until all sections complete
   ↓
6. DocumentAssembler (combine sections)
   ↓
7. DocumentCompleteness (analyze full document)
   ↓
8. CompletenessReport (generate detailed report)
   ↓
9. CompletenessGate (check if score ≥ 70%)
   ↓                    ↓
   (OK)            (needs_improvement)
   ↓                    ↓
10. SectionCommittee    SectionRevision
    ↓                    ↓
    (approve/reject)     Loop to step 1
    ↓
11. Publisher → End
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Section Review**: All sections are now reviewed before assembly
2. **Revision Loop**: Low completeness triggers section revisions
3. **Feedback Distribution**: Completeness issues converted to section-specific feedback
4. **Complete Pipeline**: Document now flows through all stages including committee

## Expected Behavior

1. Sections drafted in batches of 3
2. Each batch reviewed immediately
3. Process continues until all sections complete
4. Document assembled from reviewed sections
5. Completeness analysis performed
6. Low scores (< 70%) trigger revision cycle
7. High scores proceed to committee
8. Committee approves/rejects
9. Approved documents published

The workflow now properly iterates to improve document quality rather than terminating prematurely.
